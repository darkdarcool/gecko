# Gecko

Gecko is an experimental, open source, and easy to use language for beginners to use.

## Installation

There is no installation for gecko currently since there is no compiler yet, but you can clone the repo and see the generated AST

## Example

This is what I would like the language to look like:

```
import std.io;

fn main() -> number {
    io.println("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
```

## Contributing
